Hi! I'm Saya.

I'm a front-end developer who is currently pivoting my way into tech. My background in the hospitality industry and international agriculture education has given me the ability to be a diversified thinker, challenging and a team player. 

I'm a curious person who is never stop learning and also I can always find enjoyments there. 

I'm super looking for working in tech community and eager to improve my programming skills!
